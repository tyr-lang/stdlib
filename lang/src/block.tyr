/**
 * A block can be passed to cheaply abstract from function implementations.
 * In functional programming, this would be a Î»-expression.
 * In contrast to functional programming, we care about efficiency and the
 * quality of generated code.
 * Therefore, we pass a block of computation in the front-end to an
 * implementation and generate code at call-site.
 * This strategy allows encapsulation on both sides.
 * In constrost to passing of function pointers, this strategy cannot be applied
 * to dynamically dispatching methods, as the called function implementation has
 * to be known to the front-end.
 * Likewise, dynamic linking cannot be combined with block-parameters.
 * On the positive side, the generated code can be fully optimized.
 *
 * @note A block is constructed automatically on overload resolution.
 *
 * @note In case of dispatching methods, the static type of the argument decides
 *       which implementation is taken. I.e. if an array is known to be an
 *       array, efficient indexing based iteration can be created. Otherwise,
 *       an iterator will be created. This behaviour is optimal in the sense
 *       that a programmer cannot safely write better code. It relies on
 *       overriding methods not blattantly violating their interface, which is
 *       a general rule of inheritance.
 *
 * @note The dependent block parameters cannot be reflected as part of the
 *       Blocks type atm.
 *
 * @note If a function taking a block would update a parameter of the block, 
 *       then, that very function would take a BlockParameter.
 *
 * @note The evaluation of a function taking Blocks will evaluate each parameter
 *       at most once, i.e. non-CT parameters will be stored in anonymous values.
 *
 * @note Block is essentially a CFG literal.
